* In this assignment, we are going to apply some of the build <span class="hl kwa">in</span> data set <span class="hl kwa">in</span> R <span class="hl kwa">for</span> descriptive statistics analysis.
* To earn full grade <span class="hl kwa">in</span> this assignment, students need to complete the coding tasks <span class="hl kwa">for</span> each question to get the result.
* After finished all the questions, knit the document into HTML format <span class="hl kwa">for</span> submission.

<span class="hl com">### Question 1</span>

d. Create two tables to summarize 1) average mpg <span class="hl kwa">for</span> each cylinder class and 2) the standard deviation of mpg <span class="hl kwa">for</span> each gear class.

e. Create a crosstab that shows the number of observations belong to each cylinder and gear class combinations.

<span class="hl com">#In an attempt to understand the data more, I built a plot observing the market </span>

<span class="hl com">#When looking at the middle 50% of neighborhoods across all years, the expected variation, </span>

<span class="hl com">#  with other boros. Considering no outliers, the minimum is around $25/sqft and the max is </span>
<span class="hl com">#  around $365/sqft. the IQR sits between $115/sqft and $240/sqft. </span>
  
<span class="hl com">#  Brooklyn <span class="hl kwa">in</span> a majority of cases across year built comes <span class="hl kwa">in</span> second. The only exception would</span>
<span class="hl com">#  be with houses built <span class="hl kwa">in</span> 2000 and onward where it comes <span class="hl kwa">in</span> third. The max extends up to $140/sqft</span>
<span class="hl com">#  and the minimum goes down to $20/sqft. regarding IQR, Brooklyn stays between $50/sqft and$90/sqft.</span>
  
<span class="hl com">#  Queens comes <span class="hl kwa">in</span> third <span class="hl kwa">in</span> terms of market value, except <span class="hl kwa">for</span> homes built 2000 and onward where it comes</span>
<span class="hl com">#  <span class="hl kwa">in</span> second. Interestingly enough, Queens exhibits the only noticeable shift <span class="hl kwa">in</span> market value once reaching </span>
<span class="hl com">#  the year 2000. The max and min <span class="hl kwa">for</span> Queen sits between $40/sqft and $135/sqft. This is partly due to </span>
<span class="hl com">#  the massive jump, <span class="hl kwa">if</span> Queens stuck with its other time periods it might be sub 100 <span class="hl kwa">in</span> this category</span>
  
<span class="hl com">#  Bronx is <span class="hl kwa">next</span> on the list coming <span class="hl kwa">in</span> at fourth <span class="hl kwa">in</span> terms of market value. The Max and Min are $25/sqft and</span>
<span class="hl com">#  $85/sq ft, <span class="hl kwa">while</span> the IQR is $30/sqft to $60/sqft. Staten Island, which when observing the plot does not </span>
<span class="hl com">#  have many neighborhoods, is similar <span class="hl kwa">in</span> market value to the Bronx. It stations itself right around the </span>
<span class="hl com">#  median market value which is around $35/sqft to $50/sqft.</span>
  
<span class="hl com">#Additionally, correlations can be found <span class="hl kwa">in</span> the relationship between market value and boro. Prior to cross</span>
<span class="hl com">#examining the three variables Market Value per square foot, Year Built, and Boro, i needed to convert Boro</span>
<span class="hl com">#into a numerical value to simplify the analysis. However, one cannot vaguely assign these categorical, rather</span>
<span class="hl com">#there must be meaning behind it assignment <span class="hl kwa">in</span> order to find at least some correlative aspects. So, I used the </span>
<span class="hl com">#median household income from 2010 of each respective boro as a ranking, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the </span>
<span class="hl com">#highest. </span>

<span class="hl com">#The following order emerged: (1) Bronx, (2) Brooklyn, (3) Queens, (4) Manhattan, (5) Staten Island. Currently </span>
<span class="hl com">#Manhattan surpassed Staten Island <span class="hl kwa">for</span> Median Income. But, to go along with the data I chose income information</span>
<span class="hl com">#on the the most recent build year <span class="hl kwa">in</span> the data set which was 2010. Within the correlation matrix and corresponding </span>
<span class="hl com">#heatmap, Market Value and Boro are depicted to have a moderately positive correlation. This means as you go up <span class="hl kwa">in</span> </span>
<span class="hl com">#Median Household Income you can expect an increase <span class="hl kwa">in</span> Market Value Per Square foot. When observing Market Value and</span>
<span class="hl com">#Year built, the correlation is weak, thus implying no strong relationship between the two variables. This confirms </span>
#my earlier hypothesis that it does not necessarily depend on <span class="hl sng">&quot;when&quot;</span> your house was built but rather <span class="hl sng">&quot;where&quot;</span> it was built.

<span class="hl com">#In Conclusion, this research provides insight on the Housing Market of New York City and the relationship Market Value </span>
<span class="hl com">#per square foot has with the native boros the city finds itself split into and the years they were built. Bringing <span class="hl kwa">in</span> </span>
<span class="hl com">#outside information on median household <span class="hl kwa">in</span> section c gives greater purpose to the numerical ranking each boro has. </span>
<span class="hl com">#This enables categorical data to be more efficiently observed <span class="hl kwa">in</span> correlative terms. Statistically, the box plots <span class="hl kwa">in</span></span>
<span class="hl com">#section a provide great depth on the distribution of market values across various neighborhoods <span class="hl kwa">in</span> different boros.</span>
<span class="hl com">#Breaking it down into its constitutent data relationships was key to understanding what variables play a part <span class="hl kwa">in</span> </span>
<span class="hl com">#market value.</span>
